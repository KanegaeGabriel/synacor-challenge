This is my take at solving the [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/).


The virtual machine is implemented at [virtualMachine.py](virtualMachine.py), the disassembled code with a couple comments is at [challenge-commented.asm](challenge-commented.asm), and the folders [puzzle-solvers](puzzle-solvers) and [decrypt-memory](decrypt-memory) contain some pieces of code which were helpful when solving the puzzles.


There's also a complete writeup at [writeup.md](writeup.md), which was almost as fun to write as going through the challenge itself!


Thanks to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) for creating this challenge.
